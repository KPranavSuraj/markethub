In the fast-growing e-commerce industry, product prices and sales data change very frequently, making it difficult for users to track trends and performance. MarketHub is a web-based e-commerce analytics and price tracking application developed to help users monitor product prices and analyze sales performance easily.
The application is built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It allows users to view product analytics, track price variations, and understand product performance across different platforms. Redis is used for caching and session management to improve application speed and reduce server load.
To handle background processes such as price updates and analytics tasks, RabbitMQ is used for message queuing and communication between services. This helps in managing tasks efficiently without affecting the main application performance.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are implemented for user authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to the platform. Elasticsearch is used for efficient data indexing and searching, which helps in fast retrieval of product and analytics data.
Overall, MarketHub provides a simple and effective solution for tracking e-commerce trends and making better data-driven decisions.
